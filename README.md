localhost:3000# Credit Card Check App
This is just a basic mock up app that validates credit card input.

You can see live version [here](https://cc-check-app.herokuapp.com/)

# Functionality
A client server app. Server is in [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) using [express](http://expressjs.com/) web framework.

After running server locally (see How to run? section), once you open the app, you will see a credit card detail form. Upon submit it validates the input in the client side and if all input validations are ok it does a asynchronous request to server for credit card number check.

Server validates credit card number and returns isValid = ('true' || 'false' ) and Card type = ('Visa'||'Master Card'||'American Express'||'UnKnown')
